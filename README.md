Event Rocket
============

Testbed for adding super powers to The Events Calendar/Events Calendar PRO (!)

Basic usage:

* It's a plugin!
* Activate TEC/ECP - this plugin depends on them
* Add `[event_rocket_calendar]` to a page or post
* The calendar widget should appear wherever you added that shortcode!
* You can even add params like `[event_rocket_calendar count="3"]` to limit the number of events listed beneath the calendar
